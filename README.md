# ArchivesSpace-localization
Dutch localization files for the ArchivesSpace application
These are drafts, replacing the en.yml files (additional language should be configured, is TODO)

3 files
1. en.yml: 
- move to /locales folder

2. nl-enums.yml: 
- rename to en.yml
- move to /locales/enums folder


3.nl-common.yml:
- rename to en.yml
- move to WEB.INF/config/locales  in wars/fronend.war (you'll need to extract compress the .war file)
